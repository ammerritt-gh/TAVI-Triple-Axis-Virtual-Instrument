# Example per-mirror m-values file for FlatEllipse_finite_mirror NMO component
# Format: index<TAB>mf_front<TAB>mb_back
#
# mf = m-value for front (inner) coating facing optical axis
# mb = m-value for back (outer) coating 
# m > 10 results in perfect (R=1) reflections
#
# This allows different supermirror coatings on different shells
# Outer mirrors typically need higher m-values for larger acceptance angles
# Inner mirrors can use lower m-values (cheaper, better reflectivity)
