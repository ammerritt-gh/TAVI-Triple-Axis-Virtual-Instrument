# Example B-values file for FlatEllipse_finite_mirror NMO component
# Format: index<TAB>b_value (distance to optical axis in meters)
# 
# The b-values define the semi-minor axes of the nested ellipses
# Mirrors are ordered from outermost (largest b) to innermost (smallest b)
# These values can be calculated using the iterative formula from the paper
# or measured from an existing NMO assembly
